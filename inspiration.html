<b><center>KALPANA CHAWLA</center></b><hr>
<p>Kalpana Chawla was the first Indian woman to set foot on outer space. After completing her post-graduation in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas in 1984, she was conferred with a doctorate degree in the same field, from the University of Colorado.

Along with these professional degrees, she held the licensed Certificate of Flight Instructor.

Thanks to her employment with NASA, the world’s largest space exploration agency that Kalpana experienced her first encounter with outer space in 1997.

This was her long-cherished dream that came true. She got another such opportunity to travel to outer space for the second time in 2003.

But this mission ended in a tragedy when the space shuttle she was in malfunctioned and exploded before landing. Post her demise, the Indian government named its first weather satellite as “Kalpana-1” in her memory.</p><hr>

<b>CAREER:<B></br>
<p>In 1988, Chawla joined the NASA Ames Research Center, where she initially conducted computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts. Much of Chawla's research is included in technical journals and conference papers. In 1993, she joined Overset Methods, Inc. as vice president and Research Scientist specializing in simulation of moving multiple body problems. Chawla held a Certified Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1991, she applied for the NASA Astronaut Corps.[18] Chawla joined the corps in March 1995 and was selected for her first flight in 1997. </b><hr>
